I would like to express my gratitude to a number of people who helped me see this project through. First and foremost to my PhD advisor, Istv치n K칩nya for his supervision and guidance over the years of my PhD; to Tohid Atashbar, my former IMF internship supervisor for his co-authorship on the IMF Working Paper, as well as for his suggestions on this paper; to Gergely G치nics for his suggestions on fine-tuning the methodology used in this paper; to Anh Nguyen and D치niel Baksa for their suggestions on alternative specifications that would support my results; as well as to former colleagues from my IMF internship and current colleagues from academia, who provided insightful comments during seminar presentations.
